# Home Service Robot Project

This project was completed on Udacity Workspace, therefore assumes `catkin_ws` is located at `/home/workspace/catkin_ws`.

First, initialize `catkin_ws`:
```sh
cd /home/workspace
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Then, clone this repository into `catkin_ws/src` folder. Note that this repository already includes official ROS packages compatible with this repository: [gmapping](https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping), [turtlebot_teleop](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop), [turtlebot_rviz_launchers](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_interactions), and [turtlebot_gazebo](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator). Their dependencies must be installed to succesfully use this repository:
```sh
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hemingchen/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot-Project.git
rosdep -i install gmapping -y
rosdep -i install turtlebot_teleop -y
rosdep -i install turtlebot_rviz_launchers -y
rosdep -i install turtlebot_gazebo -y
cd ..
catkin_make
```

To run the `home_service.sh` script or any other shell scripts located at the root directory, open a new terminal window and run the following commands.
```sh
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
cd src
./home_service.sh
```

The custom world and map file generated by ROS navigation package can be found in `World` folder.

A short video as the final result of the project can be found below, where the robot moves to object location, picks it up and eventually carries it to the destination.
